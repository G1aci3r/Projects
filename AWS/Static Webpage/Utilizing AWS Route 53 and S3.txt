Utilizing AWS Route 53 and S3 services, follow these steps to seamlessly create and deploy your website.

1) Start by purchasing a domain name through Route 53 and registering it.
2) Once the domain is acquired, proceed to S3.
3) In S3, create a new bucket with the same name as your domain (e.g., discoverwithdon.com).
	- Choose the region closest to you for efficient deployment and reduced latency.
	- Ensure "Block all public access" is unchecked to allow users to view your website.
	- Keep other settings as default.
4) Once the bucket is created, enter the bucket, and click on "Upload."
5) Upload all website-related files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.).
6) For static websites, navigate to properties inside the bucket after uploading files. Enable static website hosting, enter        the index document, and save changes.
7) Inside the bucket, navigate to permissions, enter a bucket policy, and save changes.
8) Example Bucket Policy (replace "Bucket-Name" with your bucket name):
	- Example Bucket Policy (replace "Bucket-Name" with your bucket name):
	
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}


8) S3 setup is complete. Return to Route 53.
9) In Route 53, click on your website domain and create a record.
10) Choose "Simple Routing" under Routing Policy and click next.
11) Define a simple record with the following steps:
	- Value/Route traffic to:
		- Type "Alias to S3 website endpoint"
	- Region:
		- Select the region where your bucket is located.
	- Enter S3 endpoint:
		- Select the endpoint for your website.
	- Click "Define simple record" to save your settings.


Your website is now deployed and accessible to anyone!
